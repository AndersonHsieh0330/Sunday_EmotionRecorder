# Sunday_EmotionRecorder

This is my first ever Android app and it is inspird by my everyday life emotions. I finished my first academic semester as a Uwaterloo ECE student and was on my first ever intership. First time being in a big city, working in a tech company, there's always something new everyday. A there were times where things got a bit too overwhelming, thus I thought it'd be important to keep track of my emotions and take care of myself mentally.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking back at this project now, I think the idea is great but I was overly ambitious on the features of this app. I tried to put too many unfamiliar topics of android into one app, including using notifications, services, broadcast receivers, etc. Without learning a proper project architectures, this was even more difficult and messy, which causes the process of making this app overly long. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I have a chance to start over I'd get familiar with these topics separately by making smaller apps that only takes two or three days to complete, and then build the app that I have in mind with full functionality. Even though it wasn't the most efficient way of that I took back then, but I had to start somewhere and I learned a lot!


## WMMA supports:
- Recording emotions by color of lightbulb and saving data on device locally
- Reivew recorded emotions by day
- Push notifications to remind you to record your mood, and record your emotions with notification action buttons(without opening the app)

- Writing and reading data from SQLite
- Services(StartedService/Bounded Service)
- Push notification with action buttons
- Senting broadcast and using broadcast receivers
- Setting up recyclerview
