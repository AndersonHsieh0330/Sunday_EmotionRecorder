I was responsible for building the UI and implementing firebase login. Me and my teammates decided go with React Native to build our Android app since the two other developers have experience in web developement. Thus I took courses on React Native and React for web developement before the two day hackthon starts. It was a bit of a rush for me to take a on a new framework within a week, but it certainly enhanced my ability to learn fastly and efficiently.

**Note: The [WMMA_RESTAPI](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/WMMA_WhereMyMoneyAt_RestAPI) is published on Heroku, but Heroku puts the API to sleep after a certain amount of idle time. Thus the first HTTP request might take longer than usual. Please wait for a little longer or send another GET request to wake up the server, if the respond time appears to be slow.**
